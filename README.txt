Skies - a distributed cloud project

The goal of this project is to manage private information distribution in the cloud safely.
With skies, you will be able to encrypt your files and distribute them among many Client applications,
these client applications are nothing more than other people's computers.
You can safely store your files anywhere due to them being well encrypted with a public-private key pair.
The clear advantage here is that you do not need to manage storing by yourself, neither you need a dedicated cloud provider.
By distributing your files among many computers, you can be sure that your files will never be lost.

You can also rent your computer's disk or ssd to store other's files. By doing so, you will earn a monetary reward.
You can clearly see a market dynamic now emerging from Skies. You pay the renters for their space, and can rent your space as well.
For the purposes of establishing this market dynamics, Brokers will also exist.
These Brokers are nodes in the network that are not necessarily storing data, but are linking many Clients, determining the price for storage etc.
Brokers will also be rewarded for their effort, based on the speed with which they resolve Transactions between Clients.

It is very possible that, if this project is successful in its aims, that a few Brokers and Clients take the lion's share of storage,
but that is not an issue. Due to each Client or Broker being completly replaceable, the network can easily manage to purge out a malicious Client or Broker.
